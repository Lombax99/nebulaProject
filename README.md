  <h1>Nebula security domains</h1>
  
Application to implement the concept of **security domains**  in a [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) network. The project had been developed for the course of [Cybersecurity M](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2023/472685) of the University of Bologna.
<br/>ATTENTION: This is a proof of concept and should not be treated as a fully working application!

### Security Domain definition
<div>
A **security domain** is a set of logically related resources that can communicate and subject to the following constraints:
<br/>- A resource can have multiple **security domains**
<br/>- The information related to the **security domain** must be present in the resource's digital certificate
<br/>- A resource can open a connection only toward another resource that share at least one **security domain** otherwise it is blocked by default
